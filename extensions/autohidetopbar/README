Purpose:
--------

Make the top bar (panel) autohideable.


Installation:
-------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called hidetopbar@fpmurphy.com
should be created. 

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.


Version:
--------

V1.0   6/05/2011    Initial version 


Notes:
------

This is strictly experimental software. There are problems
with it.  Seems to freeze at times for a few seconds. Code
needs rework.  However it does demonstrate how to make an
extension to autohide the top bar (panel)!

This has only been tested on Fedora 15.

Double click on the top bar to toggle hiding on or off.
Increase TIME_DELTA constant if double click does not
work.
